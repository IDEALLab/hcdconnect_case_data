410|RMIM System for Donor funded short term emergency/recovery projects in Sri Lanka (Period Covered: 2010-2011)|AbstractThe Result Monitoring and Information Management (RMIM) is an initiative system that has defined, promoted and supported a common approach to monitoring recovery and relief efforts and assessing their impacts in short term emergency projects in Sri Lanka. Post conflict recovery represents both a humanitarian imperative and an opportunity for accelerated development. RMIM initiative arose out of the recognition that most of the recovery programmes are developed to replace the lost assets or seeds for planting or chicks or livestocks for rearing and tracking the input level activity from planning, procurement, quality assurance, delivering at field sites, temporary storage if appropriate and finally handed over to the beneficiaries for their use by which an enabling environment to build back better. It provides opportunity for learning from the experiences in order to get things right in the future as well as influence future capacity development actions of the project team and use of beneficiary perspectives to triangulate and better understand how affected people view the quality and relevance of the recovery assistance. RMIM initiative also face the common challenges, including how to collect the data and assure its quality; how to present data in a way that decision makers can use; question about who owns the system and how it should be sustained. More fundamentally the RMIM needed to be improvised and designed at the time of project formulation and perhaps an investment in the a recovery monitoring system for small projects with short project durations six to eighteen|January 04, 2013|Chandana J.

It constitutes 44% of total area with the population of 5.7%. The province is mostly composed of barren, rugged mountains and fertile, but dry, land. Subsistence of local population mostly depends upon cultivation mostly supported by rain, rivers, artificial irrigation system, qanats and gabarbands. Climate ranges from moderate to harsh. Natural resources in the area are scarce, with the limited availability of water and arid to semi-arid land. Environmental condition is in degraded form due to the combined factors of deforestation, soil erosion, desertification and poor water shed management. Due to the water storage or scarcity, only 2.07 million hectare out of 19.4 million hectare is being cultivated. Agriculture sector is the largest user of water using around 80 percent of fresh water (GoB, 2004). The depleting water basins, insufficient water use and declining groundwater is posing serious threat to the livelihood of farmers and vulnerable of the area.
